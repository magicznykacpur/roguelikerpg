			"PapayaTales"
Hars, rough times. A tired warrior comes back home from a long bloodtrailed voyage.
He wants to see his woman, his children. Finally rest, from all the kiliing.
He enters the home, and red color hits him straight in the face. Wife dead.
Children dead. Dog dead. Mice in the attic - dead. The warrior kneels, 
he's tired, heartbroken, furious. On the wall he sees a sign. A white hand
printed on the wooden wall. Hand of Papay. What the warrior didn't knew, was
that when he was away, Papay terrorized the country. Raped the women, killed the children,
took the whole land for himself. His white folks follow his every order, killing everything
in their path. Our hero sets on a journey for revenge and redemption. He'll grow stronger
with each enemy killed, to finally kill the one who's responsible.
